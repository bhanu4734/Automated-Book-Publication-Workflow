The Gates of Morning

Book 1, Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder


Dick, perched on a coral ledge, gazed south. Behind him, the outer ocean roared, its spume scattered by the wind. Before him, the lagoon of Karolin stretched, a tranquil expanse of infinite blue, alive with the cries of fishing gulls.  This vast, coral-ringed pond, a tempestuous sea in high winds, a placid azure lake in gentler breezes, was now his. He, a stranger arrived but yesterday.

The beach throbbed with activity. Women, children, youths—the entire tribe—toiled under the relentless sun: fishing, playing, tending their paraka patches.  They were his people now.  His were the canoes drawn upon the sand, his the empty houses that once sheltered war canoes.

His gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses; his brow furrowed. Turning his back to the tranquil water, he faced the crashing waves and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, invisible but ever-present, lay Palm Tree, an island of breathtaking beauty, yet haunted by malevolent spirits.

Nearby, little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net-maker, looked up at him. Tari understood little of the world, but he knew that war had swept away Karolin’s men, leaving the women, boys, and children defenseless, leaderless. Then, yesterday, a stranger had arrived from the northern sea, in a strange boat, accompanied by Katafa, the girl lost at sea years before. The women called him a god-sent chief.

The child, unburdened by the complexities of adulthood, asked the simple question, "Taori, who are you?"  (é kamina tai)

Could Dick have answered truthfully? Would the child have understood the strange tale of Dick Lestrange, a boy left alone on Marua (Palm Tree) with an old sailor named Kearney?  A tale of a childhood spent building miniature ships, learning to fish and spear, of Katafa's arrival, Kearney’s death, their escape from murderous Melanesians who had ravaged the island and burned their ship.

But he couldn't. The name "Dick" was a fading echo; Kearney, his foster father, a hazy memory, lost in the radiant glare of his tropical past.  Time, for the shipwrecked, blurs and obscures; for Dick, life began only with Katafa's arrival on Marua. Everything before was shrouded in a luminous fog. Only Kearney’s toy ships remained as tangible links to a forgotten past.

He looked down at the questioning child. “I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?”

“I do not know,” the child replied.  “I ask as I breathe, but the elders never answer Tari’s questions.  Ai, the fish!”  His attention flitted to children hauling in a net, and he scampered away.

Dick’s gaze returned to the north.  The child's question stirred his memory: the burning schooner, the desperate escape with Katafa in Kearney’s dinghy, their arrival, the women and children’s awe.  But the memory of their escape was tainted by the lingering menace of the Melanesians.

There was no immediate threat. The men of Palm Tree had no canoes, but they would build them.  They would see the shimmering reflection of Karolin’s lagoon in the sky, just as he had, and they would come. It might be a long time, but they would come.

Dick, though essentially a native, retained the mind of a man of European stock. He possessed foresight, a capacity for strategic thinking, for imagination.  This was why he’d sent a canoe to summon Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—skilled canoe builders, too old for war—why his eyes lit up at the sight of a hundred youths nearing fighting age.  But beneath all, fueling his actions, was his love for Katafa, a love threatened, however faintly.

War canoes!  Would he defend the lagoon, or launch a preemptive strike?  The question hung unanswered.

A hand rested on his shoulder.  Katafa stood before him, a stray lock of dark hair escaping its vine binding, fluttering like an eagle’s feather. Her luminous dark eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the northern horizon.

“Look!” she whispered.

Under specific weather conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, became visible through mirage.  They had seen it last night, and now it reappeared: a faint stain, a dull spot in the sea’s brilliance, gradually sharpening, solidifying, until the island materialized, diaphanous yet vivid, hauntingly beautiful.

Shoulder to shoulder, they stood silent, their untutored minds unaware of mirage, their eyes fixed on the scene of their escape.  They saw again the savages on the beach, monstrous figures from a nightmare.  They felt the wind in the sails of their dinghy, heard the yells of the rum-maddened Melanesians.  Before them rose the island of their trauma, its beauty masking the demons that still dwelled there.

As Dick gazed, a mixture of threat and warning, hate flared in his eyes. They had threatened him—that was nothing. They had threatened Katafa—that was everything.  And the threat remained.

Some day they would come.  Palm Tree's reappearance seemed to echo his instincts.  They would build canoes, see the lagoon’s reflection, and come. They lacked women; Karolin had them. He sensed it as keenly as he had felt his own attraction to Katafa – the invaders would be drawn to Karolin's women. They would scan the horizon for vulnerable targets and find Karolin's mirrored light beckoning them.

The danger, he knew, lay not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred roamed. Not only amongst savages, but within the wolves of civilization itself.

For Dick, the world was confined to the waters surrounding the two islands.  No Europe, no America, no history but his own short life and Katafa's.  Yet, even in this brief span, he’d learned to fear men, to understand the primal force that shaped history: man's instinct for war, plunder, and destruction.

Slowly, the vision of Palm Tree faded, vanished as if extinguished. Turning from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to an approaching canoe from the southern beach. It carried the canoe builders.  Leaving the coral, they walked towards the white sand to meet them.
